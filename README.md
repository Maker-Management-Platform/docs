#### Create and manage projects

#### Projects are a collection of assets like models, images, slice files and documents

#### You can preview multiple models at the same time and see how they fit together

## Runing mmp locally

docker-compose.yml
``` yaml
---
version: "3.6"
services:
  agent:
    image: ghcr.io/maker-management-platform/agent:latest
    container_name: agent
    volumes:
      - ./library:/library # should contain your project library
      - ./data:/data # will contain config and state files
    ports:
      - 8000:8000 # currently required for your slicer integration, looking for a workaround
    restart: unless-stopped

  ui:
    image: ghcr.io/maker-management-platform/mmp-ui:latest
    container_name: ui
    ports:
      - 8081:8081
    environment:

```
  ## Breaking changes
  - v1.3 - now all the generated assets are created in a data/assets folder (https://github.com/Maker-Management-Platform/mmp-ui/issues/127).  
  After the first run the new version and ensure everything is ok you can delete all the .project.stlib files and generated assets from the library folder. Example commands ( run at you own risk)
  ```
    cd <your lib path>
    find . -name ".project.stlib" -type f -delete
    find . -name "*.thumb.*" -type f -delete
    find . -name "*.render.*" -type f -delete
  ```

## FAQs

### How do I create a Thingiverse token?
To get a Thingiverse token go to [Apps](https://www.thingiverse.com/apps/create) > Create an App  
Select "Web App" fill in any name & description, accept the policy, and click on "Create & Get App Key" at the top of the page.  
Use the "App Token" for the `integrations -> thingiverse -> token` setting.


### How to I import my huge collection to the platform?
Just mount your collection root folder in the `/library` volume, MMP runs a discovery routine on start up and will create projects based on your directory structure.  
The name of the directory that contains your assets will be the project name and the name of all the folders in the path will become tags to ease your search.  
Other details like the description or links will need to be added manually through the UI

### How do I reset my library if anything goes wrong or I wish to uninstall?
This process is irreversible and will delete all the mmp related data, leaving your library untouched.  
You can reset all the information stored by deleting all the `.project.stlib` files, you can use the following command `find . -name ".project.stlib" -type f -delete`  
You can also delete all generated gcode thumbnails by running `find . -name "*.thumb.png" -type f -delete` and all the stl renders with `find . -name "*.render.png" -type f -delete`

### How can I contribute?
If you want to contribute with a bug fix for the current version use the `latest` branch  
If you want to contribute for a future release use the `master` or `main` branch
